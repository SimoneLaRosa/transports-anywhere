# multi-SKU vehicle optimization

This article presents an optimization model developed to address challenges in vehicle planning within the transportation context. The model aims to optimize the allocation of vehicles carrying multi-SKU loads, characterized by different sizes and loading capacities. Additionally, the model addresses the issue of collaboration with third-party warehouses that operate according to strategies and procedures not directly controlled by the parent company, generating uncertainty about the validity of information and data available from ERP systems. The proposed approach involves exporting data from ERP systems and performing thorough data validation and cleansing, followed by the application of advanced optimization algorithms for vehicle planning.

The first step of our model involves exporting data from transport management ERP systems. In our specific case, we used Python code to export data from the "Transport Management" ERP system. This code searches for the most recent file in the specified folder, loads the Excel workbook using the pandas library. This process provides us with the raw data needed for subsequent analysis and optimization. Once the data is imported, we proceed to create a pivot table for better analysis and optimization. The pivot table allows us to organize the data clearly and structured. After gaining a clear understanding of market demand, we move on to the second step of our model, which focuses on exporting data from SAP to obtain reliable information on stock availability. This step provides us with an accurate view of the available stock and helps us identify any discrepancies or computer-related issues.

Once the data validation and cleansing phase is completed, optimization algorithms are applied for vehicle planning. These algorithms consider the different sizes and loading capacities of products, optimizing the allocation of loads in vehicles. The main objective is to maximize operational efficiency by reducing delivery times and minimizing transportation costs.

The final step of our model focuses on optimizing vehicle planning. This step represents the core of the model as it addresses the issue of how to optimally load SKUs into vehicles. The proposed code uses two main criteria for vehicle generation and loading.
The first criterion is based on generating vehicles based on the total volume occupied by the merchandise and the capacity of the specific vehicle or container. Since we are dealing with multi-SKU loads, we cannot rely on a fixed loading capacity for vehicles. Instead, we consider an ideal saturation of the vehicle, taking into account the specific dimensions and capacities of the vehicle or container, based on the total volume of the products. This allows us to maximize the utilization of space inside the vehicles. The second criterion concerns minimizing different SKUs within the vehicles. This criterion is important to optimize and simplify warehouse operations during the loading and handling of goods. Loading the same type of product reduces complexity and increases the efficiency of warehouse operations. Through this optimization process, our model ensures vehicle planning based on volume occupancy and the reduction of different SKUs. This allows us to maximize vehicle utilization and simplify warehouse operations, contributing to more efficient load management and goods handling.

Finally, to facilitate the user in executing the previously described steps, an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) has been created. This interface allows for easy execution of the various model operations. Below is the code for implementing the graphical user interface using the tkinter library.

In conclusion, the presented optimization model represents an important solution for addressing challenges in vehicle planning in transportation. By integrating data control and cleansing from ERP systems with advanced optimization algorithms, the model enables efficient and accurate vehicle allocation management. This leads to better market demand satisfaction, reduced operational costs, and increased business competitiveness.
Adding additional criteria and improving the model's performance are potential future developments. The presented optimization model provides a solid foundation for vehicle planning, but it is important to note that there are still opportunities for optimization and refinement. For example, considering additional criteria such as the weight of goods, transit restrictions, or customer priorities could be beneficial. Integrating such criteria could allow for even more precise and personalized planning tailored to the specific needs of the business and customers. Furthermore, the implementation of machine learning algorithms could further enhance the predictive capability of the model. Analyzing historical data and learning from previous patterns could enable the system to identify hidden patterns and trends, supporting even more intelligent and evidence-based decisions.
